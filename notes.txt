To start with, I want to make a really basic MUD server as a PoC. It should have
the following basic features:

 * I can create a character.
  * I can choose my character's name.
 * I can login as a character.
  * I am prompted for my character's name and password.
 * I can move in four directions: N, E, S, W
 * Upon entering a room, I receive a description of that room,
   a list of the neighboring rooms, and a list of the other players
   in that room.
 * When someone enters or leaves a room, the players in that room
   are notified.

 * Players can re-look at the room they're in by using the 'look'
   command.

 * Players can send a chat message to other players in the room
   using the 'say' command.

 * Similarly, players can emote with the 'emote' command.

 * Rooms can have NPCs. NPCs can move from room to room like players,
   along with the appropriate notifications.

 * Players should be able to tell NPCs and other players apart.

 * Players can 'look' at NPCs.

 * NPCs have dialogue with branching dialogue options.
  * The player can talk to an NPC with the 'talk' command.
  * The player is presented with the dialogue and the list of responses.
    The player can then select which one they want, leading to another
    dialogue and set of responses, etc.
  * If an NPC wants to move to another room while in dialogue, the 
    dialogue "session" should end, with an optional "goodbye" message
    from the NPC.

 * Rooms can have objects.
  * Objects have a name and description.
  * Players can look at objects using the 'look' command.
  * Objects aren't explicitly listed; they should be implied from the
    room's description.
